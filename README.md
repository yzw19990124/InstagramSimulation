# Instagram Simulation

This project aims to simulate some basic functionalities of Instagram using a simplified backend and frontend setup.

## Structure

The project is structured into a main folder named `skeleton`, which contains the core logic and templates for rendering the UI.

### Core Logic

- [`schema.sql`](https://github.com/yzw19990124/InstagramSimulation/blob/main/skeleton/skeleton/schema.sql): This file defines the database schema used in the project.

### Templates

The `templates` folder contains HTML files for rendering various pages and functionalities of the simulated Instagram platform, such as creating albums, adding friends, viewing photos, and more.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the `skeleton/skeleton` directory.
